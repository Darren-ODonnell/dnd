Completed
E01: Panel and Subs components not centered -
    typical centering methods did not work (Margin 0 auto, align-pitems, justify-content
    added a style param to box, now I can set the style based on the container.

E02: Image not balanced - right side was wider than left -0 making boxes look off line
    Image edited and corrected, now balanced

if there is an earlier empty spot it moves there rather than where placed - fixed
